# Autoscroll Flex

This is a tool primarily designed to assist with reading vertical scrolling comics like manhwa (and sometimes manga). It is meant to be a flexible autoscroll where the user can easily set the speeds and adjust them while reading without having to interrupt their reading and click through a menu.

It will have:
- three autoscrolling tools
    - A customisable override of firefoxes default autoscroll (activated via middle click)
    - A gliding scroll activated and controlled via hotkeys (or the popup)
    - A stepped scroll activated and controlled via hotkeys (or the popup)
- The ability to configure hotkeys
- A blacklist to deactivate the tool on certain websites
